# ToDo List

- Find a way to use geoURIs instead of OSM Short Links for more portability between mapping apps
  - Right now GeoURIs, while they exist, have no default handler on any OS or mobile device
- Contribute back to OSM by adding [gluten_free=yes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Item:Q3176) tag on locations that get listed here but are not tagged correctly on OSM
