# ToDo List

## Lists

### Grocers

- Figure out if this is just a new type in 'restaurants' or it's own list
- What grocers stock is VERY subject to change (and supply chain issues cause accessability disruptions)
- Grocers, unlike Restraurants, are more likely to have different stock based on geographic region, even inside the same city
  - Figure out some easy to read and easy to enter format for essentially location-by-location grocers
- Grocers probably does need to be it's own lists due to the fact that at least ONE key will be unique to them: GF Shelf labeling / GF Section(s)
 
### Products

- Products, even more so than grocers, are HYPER subject to change in their GF status (due to ingredient and recipy changes over time)

## Features

- Find a way to use geoURIs instead of OSM Short Links for more portability between mapping apps
  - Right now GeoURIs, while they exist, have no default handler on any OS or mobile device
  - Google has it's own implementation (location codes) but it's exclusive to Google Maps
 
## Contribute back

- Contribute back to OSM by adding [gluten_free=yes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Item:Q3176) tag on locations that get listed here but are not tagged correctly on OSM
