# Restaurants

For now these are organized by geographical area to make it easy to look up what may be nearby

General notes
* When possible, names will link to the restaurants website
  * If possible directly to their menu
* Restaurants with multiple locations will be listed once per section UNLESS one or more of the locations have substantially different GF menu options

To Qualify for the list

* Must have a GF option that would be considered a 'main' (no side-salad or backets of fries only will qualify)
* Must clearly indicate on menu or website what is or is not Gluten Free
* Restratunts will not be listed if the website clearly indicates unsafe preperation practices
  * e.g. "Food prepared may contain or come into contact with wheat"
* Restaurants will be listed even if they do NOT have a 'safe preperation' statement
  * These will be de-listed if it becomes verified that they are not actually Celiac Safe

**Key**

* **VgGF** == Vegan GF Options
* **VGF** == Vegitarian GF Options
* **PGF** == Pescatarian (fish) GF Options
* **OGF** == Omnivore GF Options (i.e. Meat options other than fish)
* **GFF** == Verified seperate GF Fryers
* **GFP** == Verified serpeate GF Prep
* **?\*GF** - **Unverified** GF Options implied by menu or website
